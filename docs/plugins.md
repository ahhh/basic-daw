# Writing plugins

A plugin is an insert effect. It sits in a track's chain (or the master's),
takes audio in, and gives audio out. The mixer, the inspector, the live engine
and the offline bounce all speak to it through the same six-method contract.

There are two ways to write one.

| | **JSON** | **JS** |
|---|---|---|
| What it is | A manifest describing a graph of Web Audio nodes | A module with a `create(ctx, offline)` function |
| Runs code | No — the manifest is interpreted, never evaluated | Yes, with full access to the page |
| Install from | A file, a URL, or pasted text | A URL, after an explicit confirmation |
| Remembered between sessions | Yes | No |
| Can do | Anything a fixed graph of native nodes can do | Anything |

**Write JSON unless you can't.** It is safe to share, it is validated before it
ever reaches the audio graph, and the app can persist it. Reach for JS only when
you need per-frame logic (see [Limits](#limits)).

---

## The one rule

> The same `create` runs inside an `OfflineAudioContext` during bounce.

That is what makes an export match what you heard, and it is the only thing a
plugin may not break. In practice it means:

- **No module loading at build time.** `create` is synchronous.
- **No state that only exists live.** The offline render builds a fresh
  instance from the same parameters and expects the same sound.
- **No `currentTime` assumptions.** Offline, `currentTime` is pinned at 0. The
  runtime already handles this for you: parameter writes are ramped live and
  instant offline.

JSON plugins get all of this for free.

---

## Quick start

The smallest useful plugin — a tremolo, three parameters, five nodes:

```json
{
  "id": "me.tremolo",
  "name": "Tremolo",
  "category": "Modulation",
  "description": "Amplitude modulation by an LFO.",
  "params": [
    { "key": "rate", "label": "Rate", "min": 0.1, "max": 20, "def": 4.5, "unit": "Hz", "log": true },
    { "key": "depth", "label": "Depth", "min": 0, "max": 1, "def": 0.6 },
    { "key": "shape", "label": "Shape", "choices": ["sine", "triangle", "square"], "def": "sine" }
  ],
  "graph": {
    "nodes": {
      "vca": { "type": "gain" },
      "lfo": { "type": "osc", "wave": "sine" },
      "amt": { "type": "gain" }
    },
    "connect": [
      ["in", "vca", "out"],
      ["lfo", "amt", "vca.gain"]
    ],
    "bind": [
      { "param": "rate", "to": "lfo.frequency" },
      { "param": "shape", "to": "lfo.wave" },
      { "param": "depth", "to": "amt.gain", "map": "x / 2" },
      { "param": "depth", "to": "vca.gain", "map": "1 - x / 2" }
    ]
  }
}
```

Paste it into **Project ▾ → Plugins… → Install pasted JSON** and it appears in
the "+ insert" menu under Modulation, with a full editor.

To install: a `.json` file, a URL, or pasted text. A file may hold one manifest
or an array of them (a "pack"); a pack installs atomically, so one bad manifest
installs nothing.

## Manifest reference

### Top level

| Field | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | yes | Namespaced, like `me.tremolo`. Must contain a `.` or `-`. This is what a saved project stores, so **never change it** once you have used the plugin in a session. |
| `name` | yes | Display name, shown in menus and the inspector title. |
| `category` | no | Groups it in the "+ insert" menu. Known: `Dynamics`, `EQ / Filter`, `Modulation`, `Delay / Reverb`, `Distortion`, `Stereo`, `Utility`. Anything else sorts to the end. |
| `description` | no | One or two sentences, shown at the top of the editor. |
| `params` | yes | The controls. See [UI components](ui-components.md) for how each field becomes a widget. |
| `graph` | yes (JSON tier) | `nodes`, `connect`, and optionally `bind`. |

### `graph.nodes`

An object mapping a name to a node. Names are identifiers; **`in` and `out` are
reserved** and created for you as gain nodes — `in` is what the previous insert
feeds, `out` is what the next one receives.

```json
"nodes": {
  "lp":  { "type": "biquad", "filter": "lowpass" },
  "dly": { "type": "delay", "maxDelay": 2.5 }
}
```

| `type` | AudioParams (bindable, connectable) | Properties | Options | |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `gain` | `gain` | — | — | Volume. The universal glue node. |
| `delay` | `delayTime` | — | `maxDelay` | Delay line. `maxDelay` (seconds, default 1) caps `delayTime` and cannot be changed later. |
| `biquad` | `frequency`, `Q`, `gain`, `detune` | `filter` | — | Filter. `filter` is one of `lowpass`, `highpass`, `bandpass`, `lowshelf`, `highshelf`, `peaking`, `notch`, `allpass`. |
| `osc` | `frequency`, `detune` | `wave` | `start` | Oscillator. `wave` is `sine`, `square`, `sawtooth` or `triangle`. Starts at time 0 unless `start: false`. |
| `constant` | `offset` | — | `start` | Constant signal, for offsetting a modulated AudioParam. |
| `shaper` | — | `oversample` | `curve` | Waveshaper. Output is clamped to [-1, 1]. `oversample` is `none`, `2x` or `4x`. |
| `convolver` | — | — | `ir`, `normalize` | Convolution. |
| `compressor` | `threshold`, `knee`, `ratio`, `attack`, `release` | — | — | Dynamics compressor. Its gain reduction becomes the plugin's readout automatically. |
| `panner` | `pan` | — | — | Stereo panner, -1 to 1. |
| `splitter` | — | — | `channels` | Channel splitter. Address outputs as `name[0]`, `name[1]`. |
| `merger` | — | — | `channels` | Channel merger. Address inputs as `name[0]`, `name[1]`. |
| `analyser` | — | — | `fftSize` | Tap that does not alter the signal. |

> **Why `filter` and not `type`?** A node's kind already occupies `type`, so
> `BiquadFilterNode.type` is spelled `filter` and `OscillatorNode.type` is
> spelled `wave`.

Every node also accepts `channelCount` (number), `channelCountMode`
(`max` | `clamped-max` | `explicit`) and `channelInterpretation`
(`speakers` | `discrete`). Forcing `channelCount: 2, channelCountMode: "explicit"`
on a node is how you make a mono source up-mix before a mid/side split, instead
of leaving one side silent.

### `graph.connect`

An array. Each entry is either a **chain** — an array of two or more endpoints,
wired left to right — or a **conditional edge**, an object with `from`, `to` and
`when`.

```json
"connect": [
  ["in", "dry", "out"],
  ["in", "lp", "wet", "out"],
  ["lfo", "amt", "lp.frequency"],
  { "from": "fbL", "to": "dR", "when": "cross" }
]
```

Endpoint syntax:

| Form | Means |
|---|---|
| `"gain1"` | The node's default input or output |
| `"split[1]"` | Output 1 as a source; input 1 as a destination |
| `"lp.frequency"` | An **AudioParam**. Only legal as a destination — this is how you modulate one node with another. |

Two things the validator will stop you on: an endpoint naming a node that does
not exist, and a graph where nothing reaches `out` (which would be silent).

### `graph.bind`

How a parameter reaches a node.

```json
"bind": [
  { "param": "freq", "to": "lp.frequency" },
  { "param": "mix",  "to": "wet.gain" },
  { "param": "mix",  "to": "dry.gain", "map": "1 - x" },
  { "param": "out",  "to": "out.gain", "map": "db2gain(x)" },
  { "to": "trim.gain", "map": "db2gain(out) * mix" }
]
```

| Field | Notes |
|---|---|
| `param` | The parameter key to read. Optional if you supply `map`. |
| `to` | `node.audioParam` or `node.property`. |
| `map` | An expression. `x` is the value of `param`; **every parameter is also in scope by name**. |
| `smooth` | `false` writes the value instantly instead of ramping over 20 ms. Default `true`. |

Binding to a *property* (`filter`, `wave`, `oversample`) takes the value as-is —
`map` is ignored, and the parameter should be a `choices` list whose options are
all legal for that property. The validator checks this.

You can bind the same parameter more than once. The wet/dry pair above is the
idiomatic use.

---

## Expressions

`map`, `when`, and every numeric field of a curve or IR recipe accept an
arithmetic expression instead of a number. Expressions are **parsed, never
evaluated** — there is no `eval` anywhere in the JSON tier, which is what makes
a manifest from a URL safe to install.

Operators: `+ - * / %` and `^` (right-associative), with parentheses.

Available names: every parameter key, plus `x` in a `map`, plus `t` and `noise`
in an IR expression. `pi`, `e`, `true` and `false` are constants; a boolean
parameter reads as `1` or `0`, which is what makes `"amount * swap"` work.

Functions:

```
min  max  abs  pow  exp  log  log2  log10  sqrt  sign  floor  ceil  round
sin  cos  tan  tanh  atan  clamp(v, lo, hi)  lerp(a, b, t)  step(edge, v)
db2gain  gain2db
```

An unknown name is a **load-time error**, not a silent `NaN` — a typo in a
manifest is reported with the offending name and the list of what was in scope.

> There is no unary minus problem, but `0 - x` reads more clearly than `-x` when
> the expression starts with it, and both work.

---

## Curve recipes

A `shaper` node needs a `curve`:

```json
"sh": { "type": "shaper", "oversample": "4x", "curve": { "kind": "tanh", "amount": "drive" } }
```

| `kind` | Fields | |
|---|---|---|
| `tanh` | `amount` | Symmetric soft saturation. `amount` ≥ 1; higher is dirtier. |
| `softclip` | `knee` | Linear below `knee` (0–1), tanh bend above. Bounded, so it is a true ceiling. |
| `hardclip` | `threshold` | Flat clip at ±`threshold`. |
| `bitcrush` | `bits` | Quantise to `bits` steps. Aliases hard — that is usually the point. |
| `fold` | `amount` | Wavefolder: reflects rather than clips. Very bright. |
| `table` | `points` | Linear interpolation through `[[x, y], …]`, x ascending in [-1, 1]. |
| `expr` | `expr` | Arbitrary shape. `x` runs -1 → 1; parameters are in scope. |

All take an optional `size` (default 2048). A curve is rebuilt only when its
inputs change, so a knob that does not feed it costs nothing — except for
`kind: "expr"`, which conservatively rebuilds on any parameter change.

Set `oversample` to `4x` for anything with gain before it. Leave it at `none`
when the aliasing *is* the effect, as in `bitcrusher.json`.

---

## Impulse-response recipes

A `convolver` node needs an `ir`:

```json
"conv": {
  "type": "convolver",
  "ir": { "kind": "expr", "seconds": "size", "expr": "noise * exp(0 - t * decay * 5) * (1 - exp(0 - t * build))" }
}
```

| `kind` | Fields | |
|---|---|---|
| `noise-decay` | `seconds`, `decay`, `damp` | Exponentially decaying filtered noise — a plain room. |
| `impulse` | — | A single unit sample. A no-op; useful as a wet/dry reference. |
| `expr` | `seconds`, `expr` | `t` runs 0 → 1 across the tail, `noise` is fresh white noise per sample. |

IRs are generated at the context's sample rate, so a 96 kHz bounce gets a 96 kHz
impulse rather than a resampled one.

---

## Rewiring: the `when` clause

Most parameters change a *value*. A few change the *shape* of the graph — a
ping-pong switch that crosses the feedback paths, say. Those need `when`:

```json
{ "from": "fbL", "to": "dL", "when": "1 - cross" },
{ "from": "fbR", "to": "dR", "when": "1 - cross" },
{ "from": "fbL", "to": "dR", "when": "cross" },
{ "from": "fbR", "to": "dL", "when": "cross" }
```

When `cross` changes, exactly the edges the plugin created are disconnected and
the active set is rewired — nothing the host connected to `in` or `out` is
touched. The engine also learns from the manifest that `cross` is a
shape-changing parameter, so its chain signature accounts for it.

Use `when` sparingly. A rewire is not click-free, and most switches are better
expressed as a map that multiplies a path to zero — see `haas.json`, where a
boolean chooses which channel is delayed with `"amount / 1000 * swap"` and no
rewiring at all.

---

## Limits

The JSON tier describes a **fixed graph of native nodes**. It cannot:

- **Run per-sample or per-frame logic.** An envelope follower needs to read a
  signal and act on it every frame. That is what the built-in Noise Gate's
  `tick(dt)` does, and it is why the gate is a JS plugin.
- **Read the signal at all.** Nothing in a manifest can branch on audio.
- **Allocate per-note or per-voice structures.** There is no note model.

If you need any of those, write a JS plugin.

---

## The JS tier

A module whose default export is a plugin spec — the same fields, with `create`
in place of `graph`:

```js
export default {
  id: "me.stutter",
  name: "Stutter",
  category: "Utility",
  params: [{ key: "amount", label: "Amount", min: 0, max: 1, def: 0.5 }],

  create(ctx, offline) {
    const input = ctx.createGain();
    const out = ctx.createGain();
    input.connect(out);
    return {
      input,
      output: out,
      update(p) { out.gain.setTargetAtTime(p.amount, ctx.currentTime, 0.01); },
      dispose() { /* stop anything you started */ },
    };
  },
};
```

`create(ctx, offline)` must return:

| Key | Required | |
|---|---|---|
| `input` | yes | The node the previous insert connects into. |
| `output` | yes | The node feeding the next insert. May be the same node. |
| `update(params)` | yes | Called on every parameter change. Must be cheap and click-free. |
| `dispose()` | no | Stop oscillators and constant sources here, or they leak. |
| `tick(dt)` | no | Called once per UI frame with seconds elapsed. Live playback only — an offline render never calls it, so anything essential to the sound must not live here. |
| `readout()` | no | A number for the inspector to display, such as gain reduction. |

Declare `rebuildOn: ["someKey"]` if a parameter changes the graph's shape.

Load one with a `.js` URL in the plugin manager. It asks first, because unlike a
manifest this executes code. JS plugins are **not** persisted between sessions.

The eleven built-ins in `src/plugins/builtin.js` are all JS plugins and are the
best reference.

---

## Validating

The validator runs at install and lists every problem at once. To check a
manifest before installing it:

```sh
node .claude/skills/daw-plugin/validate.mjs my-plugin.json
```

It uses exactly the rules the app applies — `src/plugins/schema.js` is shared,
and touches neither the DOM nor Web Audio for this reason.

## Where things live

```
src/plugins/
  registry.js      register / look up / categories / legacy id aliases
  schema.js        the node vocabulary, and the validator built from it
  graph.js         manifest → live audio graph
  expr.js          the expression compiler (no eval)
  dsp.js           curves and impulse responses, shared by both tiers
  builtin.js       the eleven effects that ship with the app
  loader.js        install from file / URL / text, persist to IndexedDB
  bundled/         the JSON plugins that ship with the app
```
